My collection of crease patterns and landmarks for origami polyhedra, inspired by John Montroll's work.

The Python scripts draw the crease patterns and calculate the landmarks that can be plugged into [ReferenceFinder](https://mutsuntsai.github.io/reference-finder/).

The .fold files are crease patterns that can be opened in programs like [Oriedita](https://github.com/oriedita/oriedita) and [flat-folder](https://github.com/origamimagiro/flat-folder). Use the no-aux versions when using flat-folder, otherwise it will break ([issue #48](https://github.com/origamimagiro/flat-folder/issues/48)).
